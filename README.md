# ðŸ”¥ Global Wildfire Forecasting using GNN and LSTM

This project presents a machine learning approach to forecast global wildfires by leveraging the power of Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM).

There are two types of adjacency definitions used in this project:

- Countries within the same continent are considered adjacent nodes.

- Geographically neighboring countries are considered adjacent nodes.

This project is part of the Pattern Recognition (2110573) course (Semester 2/2023) at Chulalongkorn University.
